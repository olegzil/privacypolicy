## StarWatch: Privacy policy

Welcome to the StarWatch app for Android!

I have written no code to collect any personally identifiable information. The app connects to the NASA servers and downloads images based on a date range specified by the user. 

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app 
    android.permission.INTERNET
    android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE
    android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
    android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE
    android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | The app needs to connect to NASA servers to fetch images. |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` | The app tracks network availability. If the network is unavailable some functionality must be turned off. |
| `android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER` | One of the features of this app is its ability to set your device's wallpaper. Without this permition, this functionality won't work. |
